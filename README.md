# Graph-Theory
A library that efficiently implements graph theory algorithms and representations.

It is built with C++20, hpp modules and GCC as the compiler.

It is primarily based on the book 'Teoria Computacional de Grafos' by Jayme Szwarcfiter and the book 'Introduction to Algorithms' by Thomas Cormen.

Note: This library is currently under construction and is not yet ready for production use.
